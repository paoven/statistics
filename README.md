### RESTful API for statistics

The main use case for API is to calculate realtime statistic from the last 60 seconds. There will be two APIs, one of them is called every time a transaction is made. It is also the sole input of this rest API. The other one returns the statistic based of the transactions of the last 60 seconds.

### Prerequisites to build and run

 * internet access for deps download
 * mvn 3
 * java jdk 8

### How to compile and run tests

```
mvn clean install
```

### How to run project (API server starts on port 8080 by default)
```
java -jar target/statistics-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### Endpoints 

#### POST /transactions

Every Time a new transaction happened, this endpoint will be called.
Body:
```
{
  "amount": 12.3,
  "timestamp": 1478192204000
}
```
Where:
 * amount - transaction amount
 * timestamp - transaction time in epoch in millis in UTC time zone (this is not current timestamp)

Returns: Empty body with either 201 or 204.
 * 201 - in case of success
 *  204 - if transaction is older than 60 seconds
Where:
 * amount is a double specifying the amount
 * time is a long specifying unix time format in milliseconds

#### GET​ ​/statistics

This is the main endpoint of this task, this endpoint have to execute in constant time and memory (O(1)). It returns the statistic based on the transactions which happened in the last 60 seconds.

```
{
"sum": 1000,
"avg": 100,
"max": 200,
"min": 50,
"count": 10
}
```

### Requirements
 * GET /statistics runs in constant time and space.
 * The API have to be threadsafe with concurrent requests
 * The API should be able to deal with time discrepancy, which means, at any point of time, we could receive a transaction which have a timestamp of the past
 * Endpoints have to execute in constant time and memory (O(1))
